    <p style="color:orange; text-align: center; font-size:25px ;"><i>I am proud to be a student of Mount Carmel School, Dwarka Sector-22. It is one of the best schools in our area, known for its discipline, values, and excellent teaching. Our school building is big, clean, and filled with greenery. The classrooms are bright and well-equipped with smart boards and learning aids. Our teachers are kind, helpful, and always encourage us to do our best. They donâ€™t just teach us subjects, but also help us become better human beings. We have many exciting activities like music, dance, art, sports, and debates. I especially enjoy our annual day and sports events. Mount Carmel also teaches us about honesty, respect, and caring for others. It feels like a second home where everyone is supportive and friendly. I am thankful to be part of such a wonderful school that helps me grow every day.</i></p>
